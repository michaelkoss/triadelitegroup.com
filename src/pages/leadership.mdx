# Triad Leadership

Most partnerships form quickly. Two people sit around having a drink and decide to work on a new business together. Generally, little thought goes into what that partnership will look like in five years. TRIAD was strategically crafted based on personality profiles, temperament, skill sets, and a shared vision for the future. Not a partnership of identical people, we saw the beauty in our differences; the benefit of talent diversity shores up our weaknesses. Our favorite thing about building a successful business is getting to know people and learning what drives their passion.

Roxie has a personality profile that is perfect for a leader. She has an equal number of driven characteristics tempered by social smoothness. She is always in tune with what the people on her team need to stay driven; to evolve to their inherent potential. Alicia was built for the utmost, detailed, efficiency. She always approaches life with maximum effort and streamlines every process for optimal productivity.

The TRIAD team works because we have diversity, knowledge, and experience where it counts but we are singularly minded on the things that matter. There is no place for ego here. We are building a culture that allows people to find their own unique abilities and honor the different abilities of others.

## ROXIE McLerran

**PARTNER**

I have been in a variety of staffing and recruiting firms over the last 19 years ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500's. I'm passionate about building a team and developing them into the future leadership of a company. Given my time in the industry, I felt I was ready to live a dream I always had for me and my family. I was asked to partner with two amazing women who shared the same dreams and goals I had. I love that we are so different in personality yet poised to bring out one another's strengths to build a successful operation solving our clients unique hiring and retention issues.

**PARTNER**

Staffing and technology are my passion. I've spent 10+ years focused on relentlessly solving problems for my clients. I've worked every position within a company from the ground up. I'm focused and driven to build efficient, productive teams for every client. I am excited to take a decades' worth of experience and put it to use in a partnership with two incredible women! I have come to understand that you can utilize the strengths within differing personalities and merge them to create a high impact team.
